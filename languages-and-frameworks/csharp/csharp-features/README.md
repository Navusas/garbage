# C# Features

My own playground to try out features shipped in each dotnet version.

The idea was born in Redgate (by my buddy [Clive Tong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clivetong?originalSubdomain=uk)) as an L&D/exercise kind of thing, but I figured it would be best if I would actually share it to the world and invest more time into this than just presenting a slide and talking about it. (nothing bad with slides, it's just my own personal preference)
