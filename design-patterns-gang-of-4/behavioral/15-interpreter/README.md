## Interpreter

Page: 243

**Summary**

The Interpreter Pattern is used to define a representation for a grammar of a given language, along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

**Applicability**

Use the Interpreter Pattern when:
- There is a language to interpret, and you can represent statements in the language as abstract syntax trees
- The grammar is simple
- Efficiency is not a critical concern
