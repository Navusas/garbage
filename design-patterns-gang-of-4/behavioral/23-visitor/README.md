Page: 331

**Summary**

Represents an operation to do on an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

**Applicability**

- many classes of object with differing interfaces, and you want to perform operations on these objects that depend on their concrete classes.

-many distinct and unrelated operations need to be performed on an object structure, and you don't want to pollute  these classes with operations. Visitor lets you keep related operations together.
