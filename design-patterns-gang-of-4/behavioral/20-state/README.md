## State

Page: 305

**Summary**

Allow an object toalter its behaviour when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

**Applicability**

- an object's behaviour depends on its state, and it must change its behaviour at run-time depending on that state

- operations have large, multipart conditional statements that depend on the object's state.
