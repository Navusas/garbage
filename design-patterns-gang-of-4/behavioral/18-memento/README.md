**Summary**

Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

**Applicability**

- a snapshot of (some of) the object's state must be saved so it can be restored later
- a direct interface to obtaining the state would expose implementation details and break the object's encapsulation.
