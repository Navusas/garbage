Page: 207

**Summary**

The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

**Applicability**

Use the Proxy Pattern when:
1. You want to hide the real functionality of an object (i.e. by having a proxy object to implement its interface, you can postpone the initialization of the object until later)
