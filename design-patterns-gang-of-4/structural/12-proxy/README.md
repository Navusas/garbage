## Proxy

Page: 207

**Summary**

The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. Since it implements the same interface, it allows you to execute some code before or after the execution of the real object's methods.

**Applicability**

Use the Proxy Pattern when:
1. You want to hide the real functionality of an object (i.e. by having a proxy object to implement its interface, you can postpone the initialization of the object until later)
