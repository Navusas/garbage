## Decorator

Page: 175

**Summary**

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

**Applicability**

- Use Decorator when you want to be able to assign extra behaviors to objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects.
- Use Decorator when it is awkward or not possible to extend an object's behavior using inheritance.
