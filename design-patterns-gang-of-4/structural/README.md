# Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the structure of the code and how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. These patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural design patterns can be divided into seven main types:

1. Adapter Pattern

    Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. This pattern lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

2. Bridge Pattern

    Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

3. Composite Pattern

    Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

4. Decorator Pattern

    Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

5. Facade Pattern

    Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

6. Flyweight Pattern

    Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing objects instead of replicating them.

7. Proxy Pattern

    Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

In summary, structural design patterns provide various ways to compose objects to form larger structures, helping developers manage the complexity of object composition and improving code maintainability and flexibility.
