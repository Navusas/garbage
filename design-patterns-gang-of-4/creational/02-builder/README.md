## Builder

Page: 97

**Summary**
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

**Use Cases**
Use the Builder pattern when:
- The algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled.
- The construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed.
-
