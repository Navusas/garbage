## Abstract Factory

Page: 87

**Summary**

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Use Cases**
Use the Abstract Factory pattern when:
- A system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
- A system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
- A family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint.
- You want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations.
