# Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on providing solutions for object creation in software development. These patterns deal with the process of object creation and encapsulate the knowledge about which classes the system uses, how they are instantiated, and how they are related. Creational design patterns can be divided into five main types:

1. Abstract Factory Pattern

    Defines an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. <br/><br/>
2. Builder Pattern: 

    Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is useful when dealing with complex objects that require a step-by-step process for creation. <br/><br/>
3. Factory Method Pattern: 

    Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, allowing subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It promotes the loose coupling between classes by eliminating the need to specify the exact class for object creation. <br/><br/>
4. Prototype Pattern:

    Allows cloning an existing object instead of creating a new one by specifying a prototype, eliminating the need to know the exact class of the created object. <br/><br/>
5. Singleton Pattern: 

    Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. <br/><br/>


In summary, creational design patterns provide various ways to create objects, helping developers manage the complexity of object creation and improving code maintainability and flexibility. <br/><br/>
