1. You can break them, but do it per business case, not domain level
2. Do GETs and POSTs

```
In example:
    NOT OrganizationController, but OnboardingController.cs
    /api/onboarding/CreateOrganization (string name)

    NOT EmployeeController, but OrgManagementController.cs
    /api/orgManagement/InviteNewEmployee (string org, string email)
```

OnboardingService...


OrganizationService
EmployeeService
